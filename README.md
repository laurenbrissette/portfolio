# Portfolio Website 
## Description 
A website I created to display my extended Projects, Resources, Education, and Experience in a fun format!  For this project, I used HTML, CSS, 
a little bit of Javascript, and Bootstrap.  I did some planning on Figma, and then made my vision a reality.  My biggest challenge throughout this 
project was understanding the relationships between HTML elements and their CSS styling.  I learned a lot about which CSS properties do what, how they interact with each other, 
and how the layers of HTML elements with distinct styling affect one another.

## Visit
To visit the site, head to the latest deployment on the github-pages link of this repository, or follow https://laurenbrissette.github.io/portfolio/.

## Plans
In the future, I plan to redo the formatting of the site to make it adjustable to irregular shaped windows on a computer, or even create a mobile device friendly format. 
When I made the formatting, I was less familiar with flexible design, and I would love to see the progress that I've made on that front more evident in the final product.
